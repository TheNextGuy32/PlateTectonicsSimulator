# Plate Tectonics Simulator
---------------------------

Link to example outputs: http://oliverbarnum.com/projects/tectonic.html

This plate tectonics simulation is based on the theory that plates break apart and slide away 
from hotspots in the asthenosphere, the layer beneath the tectonic plates. The simulation begins
by generating pangea with underlying tectonic plates. Heat is allowed to build up beneath the plates causing
each plate to move to cooler regions. Cooler plates subduct beneath warmer plates, causing mountain ranges
and great rifts to form.

This simulation uses Allegro C/C++ for primitive shape rendering and png output. 

### Features
------------
Heat convection in the asthenosphere approximates tectonic plate movement.
Seas naturally flow and level in a modified recursive flood-fill algorithm, with each tile of water 
flowing down the steepest slope causing affected tiles to do the same until a margin of flatness is achieved.
The name of the world is generated by randomly picking English vowels and consonants to produce memorable 
names such as Rabibic or Yomak.
